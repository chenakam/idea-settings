      <item value="In a large system, there is often a lot of business logic and control logic, which is the embodiment of hundreds of &quot;jobs.&quot;" />
      <item value="The relationship between tasks can also be further classified into two types: _dependent_ and _non-dependent_, that is, serial and parallel (dependent tasks must be executed sequentially, and non-dependent tasks can be executed in parallel). The user programmer only needs to focus on writing task one by one and leave the rest to the framework. Reflow is designed around the control logic that handles these tasks." />
      <item value="Inspired by this idea, we can separate the business logic from the control logic, abstract the control logic as a framework, and construct the business logic as a Task." />
